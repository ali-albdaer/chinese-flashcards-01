# Chinese Flash Cards (v1.0)

A simple flashcard application for learning Chinese vocabulary (and Rust). This is meant to be a personal short-term project, and I have no intentions of continuously developing it. 

## Demo

- You may find the deployed app here: [Chinese Flash Cards (Heroku)](https://chinese-flashcards-fa2e8975a611.herokuapp.com/)

## Features

- Select a deck, replace, remove or shuffle cards
- Choose what to see (pinyin, english, example sentences, radicals, ...)
- Quiz mode (working on it)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ali-albdaer/chinese-flashcards-01.git
    ```
2. Head to the root directory:
    ```
    cd chinese-flashcards-01
    ```
3. Host the project (requires `trunk`):
    ```
    trunk serve
    ```
